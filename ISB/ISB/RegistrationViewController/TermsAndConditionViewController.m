A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other personal information in your address book) will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">(a) notify you when your contacts become active on ISB,</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">(b) indicate which of your contacts is already a ISB user,</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">(c) correctly display the name of each contact as it appears in your address book when a call is received.</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">In addition, we may also create a function in the future that will use this data to synchronize your address book across your multiple devices.</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a &quot;historical backup&quot;. If you delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">Your phone number, which will be verified via a email message that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your EITCL user ID.</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">EITCL also maintains a Call Detail Record (CDR - see </FONT><A HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record\"><FONT COLOR=\"#386eff\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record</FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">) for each call conducted on the system. These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), EITCL servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">EITCL may interact with your phone's SMS inbox, placing incoming messages in your inbox or reading the contents of the activation SMS sent to you by EITCL.

If you choose to share your location with a specific user or group of users your location will be retrieved from your device and sent to EITCL together with your message. EITCL will only use this location for this particular purpose and delete it from its servers once the message is deleted. For the avoidance of doubt, EITCL will not share your location information and will not use it for any purpose except the one specifically requested by you.</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\"><B>Other Services</B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">In the event we make message boards and forums available to you (collectively, &quot;Forums&quot;), you will be solely responsible for the information and any other content you post on and through these Forums and should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., name, e-mail address, telephone number) on or through these Forums, such information is generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by, other users. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, and such messages are beyond our control. We do not exercise control over any users or Site visitors, and in no way are we responsible, and have any liability whatsoever, for any collection or use of information you may disclose through the Forums. This Policy does not cover such disclosure of information. You are encouraged to exercise discretion when providing personal information about yourself in and through Forums.

A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.

Sharing and Disclosure of Information</B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">We do not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to:</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</FONT></P><P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our services or members of the public.</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">In order to provide you with EITCL products you have requested, EITCL may sometimes, if necessary, share your Personal Information (excluding your address book and related information) and traffic data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents, for example: banking organizations or other providers of payment and analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. EITCL will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. EITCL will never share your address book information with any third party, except as may be required by law (see below).</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">The following is a description of how we may share your Personal Information with trusted third party partners. Should we add additional partners, we will immediately update this description:</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">1. We use three separate third party companies in order to send you an authentication SMS when you register with EITCL. In order to send you the SMS, we send one of these third party companies your phone number and the authentication message. These third parties are contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the transmission of the authentication SMS.</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">2. If we fail to send you an SMS (this happens in certain cases) you may ask us to call you and read you the authentication code on the phone. This is done using a third party automated phone system. In order to call you, we provide this third party partner with your phone number and send the &quot;audio content&quot; of the call to them. The third party partner in turn will typically use another phone provider who may use another phone provider and so on until the call reaches you. This is an industry standard mechanism for the transmission of phone calls. The third party partner is contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the completion of the authentication phone call.</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">3. We may use Push Notification Services to notify you about phone calls and messages. If we do, the phone number or the name of the person calling you may be part of the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to your device.</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-bottom: 0.13in; widows: 0; orphans: 0\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\">Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the EITCL servers that are used to store your Personal Information are owned and hosted by Amazon Web Services, LLC, an </FONT><A HREF=\"http://amazon.com/\"><FONT COLOR=\"#386eff\"><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\"><U>Amazon.com</U></FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE=\"Avenir Next Condensed\"> Company.

As part of such a transaction the new entity will be required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
